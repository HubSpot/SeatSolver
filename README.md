# SeatSolver

Auto generate seat assignments with constraints using genetic algorithms.

### Why? This whole thing seems a bit silly.

Here at HubSpot our product team shuffles seats roughly once a quarter. As we have grown, redoing our seating map every quarter has become quite a challenge.
There are a lot of different constraints that must be taken into account, and doing this by hand was becoming incredibly time consuming.
This repo is our attempt to automate a solution to this problem.
